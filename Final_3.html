				<h2>Project 1</h2>
				<img src="Cartoon (1).jpg" alt="117974.jpg">
				<p>For this project I had to work on a different art piece with the same theme and work on it each day for a full week. I chose Mickey Mouse with super powers and gave him a new super power each day. I really liked the results.</p>

				<h2>Project 2</h2>
				<img src="Untitled-1.jpg" alt="117974.jpg">
				<p>For this project I had to use color. I usually do not use color in my drawings, so this was a step in a new direction. However, once I worked on that obstacle, I really liked the final project and it really made me want to do more with color in my work to bring new ideas to my projects.</p>

				<h2>Project 3</h2>
				<img src="Altar.jpg" alt="117974.jpg">
				<p>This is one of my favorite projects I have ever done because we just had to make a character. The character I made was named Altar and I use this character in a bunch of work I make like storys, games, and drawings. Altar holds a special place in my heart for being one of the first characters I have ever made. He is like a little easter egg in my project and all my future projects. </p>
